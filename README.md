# Spatiotemporal-Analysis-of-Crime-in-London

Overview: In this project, I performed a detailed spatiotemporal analysis of crime patterns in London using data from the Metropolitan Police Service. By visualizing the data, I identified crime hotspots and analyzed how demographic factors correlated with crime rates over time. The analysis utilised K-Means clustering to uncover patterns and choropleth maps to represent crime rates geographically. This project enhanced my ability to work with large datasets, analyze geographical trends, and apply clustering techniques effectively. The research questions, methodology and results are elaborated in the report.

Aim: Understand spatiotemporal crime patterns in London and identify hotspots for effective resource allocation

Action: Conducted a spatiotemporal analysis of crime patterns in London using Metropolitan Police data. Utilized Pandas, GeoPandas, and Altair to plot line graphs and heatmaps for temporal trends, and choropleth maps with shapefiles for spatial distribution. Applied K-Means clustering to identify crime hotspots and examined correlations between crime rates and demographic factors using census data

Outcomes: Crime incidents peaked in 2019 and dropped sharply in 2020. Central London has higher crime rates with Westminster leading at 251 incidents/1,000 people. Hotspots included Oxford, Regent and Bond Streets
